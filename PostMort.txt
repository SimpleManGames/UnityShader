I got what I set out to do with inside Unity. But at first I was trying to make my own graphics engine inside c++ and OpenGL. The stress of working with my own material structure kinda burnt me out on it so I made the decision to move it to Unity. That choice turned out pretty well. I had a few bugs with the outline shader but those were easy. The CRT shader was made last year and I didn't get a few things I wanted into it like the outline around the screen, noise and crackles. But what I got was enough to show off the effect. Then the main one I focused on was the toon shader. It was tough getting to work with unity lights but the outcome was what I wanted. A few things I want to get working if I were to continue with this would be when two objects are inside eachother a outline would be drawn at the contact point. Also since I just calculate the specular I would want to get the specular map running. But that's about everything has gone and not gone.
